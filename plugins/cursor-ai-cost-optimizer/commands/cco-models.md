# /cco-models - Pick How Models Are Chosen

Use this command to set model behavior in one step.

## Choose one option
1) **Auto (recommended)**  
CCO keeps model choice automatic.

2) **Pin current mapping**  
CCO locks the currently discovered models.

3) **Custom mapping**  
You pick the model for each mode:
- fast
- balanced
- deep

That is it. CCO saves config and refreshes the runtime mapping automatically.
